Data might slightly differ from what is executed in the report, as the data is again collected at a later point.

1. DataToBeLabeled.csv : The training dataset that is to be labeled. 
    We will populate the labels using Active Learning and Weak Supervision Techniques
    Then this data will be used as train dataset to train BERT and BioBERT
 
2.  ManualAnnotatedData.csv : This is a manually annotated dataset.
    We use will use this dataset to train the active learner.
    We will also this to use to test the BERT and BioBERT models.
